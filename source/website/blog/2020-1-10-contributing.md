Well... we made this project, and we've spent some time putting things on it and we're definitely not done. Honestly, we'll never be done. Code keeps changing and so will our standards. We'll add new languages, update old one, maybe we'll <!--truncate--> add something else to this at some point.

<br/>

Essentially what I'm trying to get at is, if you want to help us update this documentation, send us an email the addresses listed below. We'll add you as a collaborator and you can make some changes and make a pull request and we'll publish it.

<br/>
Thanks for anything you contribute,
